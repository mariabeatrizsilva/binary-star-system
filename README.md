<h1>Welcome to my Binary Star System Simulator  </h1>

The attached code will provide a physically-accurate model of a binary star system with a non-circumbinary planet in MatLab.

Please see the "Write-up" file for a paper detailing the design of the system, as well as a parametric study conducted to observe the stability of the binary star system.

<!-- The code for this project was written in HTML and JavaScript with WebGL. The texture on the cups is all done procedurally, which means you can make your own set of cups! The code to modify the cups is contained in <code>basecup.js</code>. To create your own texture, scroll down to the fragment shader and create your own function that will make the texture. For example, this is where the texture for the red cup is defined: <br> <img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 10 10 06â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/mariabeatrizsilva/murano/assets/67334485/ab328cc0-9d8e-47ed-af69-cef0f2e6e063"> <br> -->
